## Proof of Stake
'In a PoS system, a blockchain **appends** and **agrees** on new blocks through a process where **anyone who holds coins** inside of the system can participate, and the **influence** an agent has is **proportional** to the number of coins (or “stake”) it holds' - [^1]
### Chain-based proof of stake
"mimics proof of work mechanics and features a chain of blocks and simulates mining by pseudorandomly assigning the right to create new blocks to stakeholders." - [^1]
### Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) proof of stake.
conflicting (false) nodes cannot be created as long as 2/3 of the nodes follow the protocol honestly.
## Proof of Work
## Block reversions

## Proposal mechanism
this is the mechanism that proposes blocks. Serves a similar role as the common abstraction of "leader election" used in traditional BFT algorithms.
